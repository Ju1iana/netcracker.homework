## MyLinkedList vs LinkedList:
<hr>

* Cool and fashionable diagram built using Mathcad. 
Thanks to the university for this acquaintance. 
I always knew that it would be useful to me in life.

* Each method containing addition, deletion, insertion, index return and cleanup was run six times. 
In the diagram we see the total time spent on this.

## Conclusion 
After implementing the basic operations of our MyLinkedList and LinkedList classes, we can 
clearly see that LinkedList works a little faster than MyLinkedList.
